## Note on Project 9.2 - Zepkins Project

The `9.2.Zepkins Project` folder is part of the Spring Cloud learning track and demonstrates how to implement distributed tracing using **Zipkin**.

Due to the large size of the original `zipkin-server-3.5.1-exec.jar` file, it has been **removed from version control** to maintain repository performance and avoid exceeding GitHub storage limits.

üîó **Download Zipkin Executable**  
Please download the latest stable Zipkin JAR from the official GitHub repository:

‚û°Ô∏è [https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin)

Look for the latest `zipkin-server-<version>-exec.jar` under the [Releases](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/releases) section.

Once downloaded, place the `.jar` file inside the `9.2.Zepkins Project` folder for local execution.
